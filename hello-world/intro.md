In this session, we'll explore how you can use the NGINX web server to load balance requests between two nodejs app containers running on the host.

With Docker, there are two main ways for containers to communicate with each other. The first is via links which configure the container with environment variables and host entry allowing them to communicate. The second is using the Service Discovery pattern where uses information provided by third parties, in this scenario, it will be Docker's API.

The Service Discovery pattern is where the application uses a third party system to identify the location of the target service. For example, if our application wanted to talk to a database, it would first ask an API what the IP address of the database is. This pattern allows you to quickly reconfigure and scale your architectures with improved fault tolerance than fixed locations.

The machine name Docker is running on is called docker. If you want to access any of the services, then use docker instead of localhost or 0.0.0.0.
