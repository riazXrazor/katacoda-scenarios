## Step 1 - NGINX Proxy
In this scenario, we want to have a NGINX service running which can dynamically discovery and update its load balance configuration when new containers are loaded. Thankfully this has already been created and is called nginx-proxy.

Nginx-proxy accepts HTTP requests and proxies the request to the appropriate container based on the request Hostname. This is transparent to the user with happens without any additional performance overhead.

## Properties
There are three keys properties required to be configured when launching the proxy container.

The first is binding the container to port 80 on the host using -p 80:80. This ensures all HTTP requests are handled by the proxy.

The second is to mount the docker.sock file. This is a connection to the Docker daemon running on the host and allows containers to access its metadata via the API. Nginx-proxy uses this to listen for events and then updates the NGINX configuration based on the container IP address. Mounting file works in the same way as directories using -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro. We specify :ro to restrict access to read-only.

Finally, we can set an optional _-e DEFAULTHOST=<domain>. If a request comes in and doesn't make any specified hosts, then this is the container where the request will be handled. This enables you to run multiple websites with different domains on a single machine with a fall-back to a known website.

##Â Task
Use the command below to launch nginx-proxy.

`docker run -d -p 80:80 -e DEFAULT_HOST=proxy.example -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro --name nginx jwilder/nginx-proxy`{{execute}}

Because we're using a DEFAULT_HOST, any requests which come in will be directed to the container that has been assigned the HOST proxy.example.
